/**
 * Single cucumber test runner. Its sole purpose is to serve as an entry point for junit. Step
 * definitions and hooks are defined in their own classes so they can be reused across features.
 *
 * This entry point is specific for INIT command behavior for scenarios where the stand-alone
 * Web API server has slightly different behavior than the GeoServer plugin. Currently, the only
 * difference is the message in the 409 Conflict response when the repository already exists. Since
 * the plugin has a RepositoryManager, it will check to see if the name is already in use. If the
 * name is already in use, the message will indicate this. The stand-alone server does not check
 * this ahead of time and only issues a 409 Conflict if the repo already exists.
